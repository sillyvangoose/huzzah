# A: Why I joined the course, for motivation, vision, aspiration? Aspiration!
# B: No real prior experience with AI beyond encountering it in every day life.
# C: Just in general more about AI, I want to immerse myself in it and branch out my knowledge!
# message + message prints it twice with no space, message*3 does it three times with no spaces in between, message in brackets 0 prints only the first letter, i think bc each number is associated with the order of the letter (0 is first letter 1 is second letter)
# I think message is a good variable name for the time being, but it should definitely change to fit the situation as time goes on

# Only audio 2 played, I think this might be because Jupyter doesn't support .mid files? Also I'm not sure where to put the attribution so I put it above in the code.

# # Thinking About Data Bias

# Article by Prabhakar Krishnamurthy thoughts below:
# I think it is very generous to say that most ML modelers don't realise the bias is happening or they do and don't know what to do about it. That is not backed up with any evidence, and no sources are cited. Additionally, ML modelers not noticing that there is a bias is a bias in itself, they are priveledged enough to not think about racism or sexism, as the majority of people involved in computer science are white and male, so they do not think about bias being there. Additionally, if most ML modelers don't know it's there, then why is the first part of the article a list of instances of bias that are backed up by evidence? I'm more inclined to agree with the instances backed up by evidence that there has been bias rather than speculation/opinions that bias does not happen.
